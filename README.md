jk-lang
========

jk is a programming languaged designed for low-level systems programming.

Target applications are things such as embedded systems, operating system
kernels and language runtimes.

If you think C is too high-level and doesn't expose enough sufficiently
expose the underlying machine, then this might interest you.

If you think assembler is pretty neat but could do with some automatic
register allocation and stacking and a little bit of type safety,
then this might interest you.

If the first thing that comes to mind when someone says 'automatic
memory management' you think *stack*, not *heap* and certainly
not *garbage collection*, then this might interest you.

If you prefer your lanaguage with a truly minimal runtime, then this
might interest you. Long live `crt0.s`.

If you're scared by pointers, then this probably isn't for you.

If you think `++` was the best thing to happen to `C`, you probably
won't like this.

If you think "jQuery is bare-metal, then this certainly isn't for you.

Very early design phase. No code, no spec, no effects.
